# SuperDuperPowers

**Harness-agnostic skills and reviewer agents for deliberate coding workflows**

SuperDuperPowers gives coding agents a practical workflow toolkit: brainstorm when the work is ambiguous, write plans when the scope is real, execute in grouped phases, review at meaningful checkpoints, and verify before claiming success.

This project is built from Jesse Vincent's [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) baseline platform and substantially modifies the workflow, packaging, and agent model.

## Included Harness Config

SuperDuperPowers is alpha software. The workflow core is intended to stay harness and model agnostic. The first included harness config is for OpenCode, installed as a package-style plugin from npm.

Add the plugin to your OpenCode config, typically `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": ["@notchrisbutler/superduperpowers"]
}
```

If npm resolution is unavailable, use the GitHub repository directly as a backup:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": ["superduperpowers@git+https://github.com/notchrisbutler/superduperpowers.git"]
}
```

For local checkout development, use a `git+file` source instead:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": ["superduperpowers@git+file:///path/to/superduperpowers"]
}
```

See [OpenCode Install](.opencode/INSTALL.md) for the included setup and verification prompts.

## Features

- Opt-in SuperDuperPowers routing with full flow, quick flow, and no-SuperDuperPowers modes
- Workflow profile tools for route, docs, execution, branch, and testing-intensity decisions
- User-level OpenCode runtime state and default worktrees under `{OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR}/superduperpowers/`
- Project-local generated specs and plans under `{DOCS_ROOT}/superduperpowers/`, local-only by default
- Brainstorming, planning, TDD, debugging, verification, and branch-finishing skills
- Grouped execution with flat, dependency-ordered task lists that stay readable in agent harnesses
- Named reviewer agents: `spec-reviewer`, `code-reviewer`, `lite-spec-reviewer`, and `lite-code-reviewer`
- Local-first finishing flow that prepares PR commands without pushing unless explicitly requested
- Included OpenCode plugin entrypoint through `.opencode/plugins/superpowers.js`
- Calendar release versioning in the form `YYYY.M.D`, with `YYYY.M.D-N` for additional same-day releases

## Core Workflow

SuperDuperPowers is opt-in by default for normal coding turns.

- Explicit requests such as `using superduperpowers brainstorming`, `using superpowers brainstorming`, `/brainstorm`, `/superduperpowers`, or `use superpowers executing-plans` load the requested workflow.
- Clearly deep and ambiguous, investigation-heavy, high-risk, or plan-heavy requests may still trigger SuperDuperPowers implicitly.
- Small reviews, quick code changes, wording edits, and config tweaks can use quick flow: check enough context, make the smallest correct change, run targeted validation when practical, and report what changed.
- Trivial requests or requests to avoid SuperDuperPowers use normal agent behavior unless SuperDuperPowers is invoked later.
- If intent is unclear, the agent should ask whether to use full flow, quick flow, or no SuperDuperPowers for the session.

Available full-flow workflows include brainstorming, planning, execution, TDD, debugging, verification, spec review, code review, and development-branch completion.

Generated SuperDuperPowers specs and plans are local-only by default. Implementation workflows can still use local commits for verified implementation task scopes and final verified implementation changes. Pushes and PR creation require explicit user instruction.

`skills/using-superpowers/SKILL.md` is the source of truth for routing details.
