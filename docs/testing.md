# Testing SuperDuperPowers

This document describes tests for the included SuperDuperPowers harness config. The workflow sources are harness-agnostic, and the first included config is the OpenCode plugin.

Packaged marketplace/plugin artifacts may include this document without shipping the `tests/` directory. Clone or use a local repository checkout before running the commands below.

## Included OpenCode Test Runner

Run the default included-config test suite from the repository root:

```bash
tests/opencode/run-tests.sh
```

The default suite runs checks that do not require an installed OpenCode binary. It verifies plugin structure and metadata assumptions that should work in a development checkout.

Run integration tests when OpenCode is available locally:

```bash
tests/opencode/run-tests.sh --integration
```

Integration tests exercise included OpenCode behavior such as skill discovery and plugin priority resolution.

Use verbose output when debugging failures:

```bash
tests/opencode/run-tests.sh --verbose
tests/opencode/run-tests.sh --integration --verbose
```

Run one named test when narrowing a failure:

```bash
tests/opencode/run-tests.sh --test test-plugin-loading.sh
```

## Test Layout

```text
tests/opencode/
├── run-tests.sh              # Main OpenCode test runner
├── setup.sh                  # Shared setup helpers
├── test-plugin-loading.sh    # Package and plugin structure checks
├── test-priority.sh          # Integration test for skill priority resolution
└── test-tools.sh             # Integration test for OpenCode skill tools
```

## Requirements

- Run commands from the SuperDuperPowers repository root.
- Use a development checkout when changing plugin code, skills, agents, or docs.
- Install OpenCode locally before running `tests/opencode/run-tests.sh --integration`.
- Keep test fixtures local and temporary; do not require global package installation.

## What To Verify

After changing included OpenCode plugin code, package metadata, skills, or reviewer agents, run the default suite:

```bash
tests/opencode/run-tests.sh
```

Run the integration suite when the change affects runtime OpenCode behavior:

```bash
tests/opencode/run-tests.sh --integration
```

Runtime behavior includes skill discovery, the `using-superpowers` bootstrap, reviewer agent registration, tool priority handling, and plugin loading inside OpenCode.

## Manual Verification Prompts

When a change needs interactive confirmation, start a fresh OpenCode session with the package configured and use the prompts from [.opencode/INSTALL.md](../.opencode/INSTALL.md).

Verify these behaviors:

- Skills from `skills/` are discoverable through the OpenCode `skill` tool.
- Reviewer agents from `agents/` are available as named OpenCode subagent types.
- The `using-superpowers` bootstrap is injected once per session.
- Quick flow stays lightweight for bounded edits.
- No-Superpowers requests avoid loading workflow skills.

## Writing Or Updating Tests

- Keep tests in `tests/opencode/` unless a future OpenCode package test requires a separate fixture.
- Prefer checks that mirror documented install strings and plugin resolution behavior when those behaviors can be validated without requiring a global user setup.
- Add integration coverage for behavior that only appears inside an OpenCode session.
- Keep default tests fast and free of external runtime requirements.
- Use `--integration` for tests that need OpenCode itself.

## Troubleshooting

If skills are not discovered, verify the plugin is installed from the expected GitHub package source or `git+file` checkout path and restart OpenCode.

If reviewer subagents are missing, check `.opencode/plugins/superpowers.js` and confirm it registers the packaged definitions from `agents/`.

If integration tests fail before running assertions, confirm OpenCode is installed and available on `PATH`.
